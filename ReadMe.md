## CARPS - Control Arps  

**PROJECT AIM** 
   
The main idea is to create an arpeggiator that can be managed by using one hand  
Arpeggiator is developed in SuperCollider  
Effects are developed in JUCE  
Hand Tracking is handled by Python with external google library [mediapipe](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/) and [cv2](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and [osc](https://pypi.org/project/python-osc/)
